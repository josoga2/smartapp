If you occasionally get “ ERROR: An error has occurred. Check your logs or contact the app author for clarification”, don’t worry. This is because the SMART App directly query data from Xena, and sometimes, the plot/calculation action has been send to server, but the data has yet to be downloaded. So, just re-click the button. everything will go well. If it’s still not working, please contact us directly.
